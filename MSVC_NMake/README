Building libxml++ with Visual Studio 2017 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 16.0) or later.  Unfortunately, due to a compiler that forbids using
  `explicit` with `virtual` (and the likes), Visual Studio 2015 and earlier are not supported, even though
  only C++-11 is required,
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/
* Build libsigc++ 2.0.6 and glibmm from source, with the same compiler version.
* Add GTK+, libsigc++ and glibmm to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio.
* Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release]` to buiild libxml++.  Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc` without the
  `CFG=[debug|release] flag to see which options are supported by the NMake Makefiles
