Building libxml++ with Visual Studio 2017 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 15.7) or later, as C++-17 is required and only 15.7 or later had
  adequate C++-17 support
* Install libxml2 from https://xmlsoft.org/, either via Windows binaries or building from source.  It is
  strongly recommended, if building libxml2 from source, that Visual Studio 2015 or later is used
* Add libxml2 to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio.
* Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release]` to buiild libxml++.  Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc` without the
  `CFG=[debug|release] flag to see which options are supported by the NMake Makefiles
